The official public roadmap is the work of engineers at [Recyclero][footer_website] aiming to
transform, eradicate and recycle unwanted and unusable materials. One of our [core beliefs][footer_principles] is
following the [open source way][footer_open] which means we strive to share as many details of our work as possible.

You can learn more about this work from [our blog][footer_blog] and by following [@TheRecyclero][footer_twitter].
